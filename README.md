Module 6 Challenge for UofD Data Analysis bootcamp

The files are WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb and they are located in the directory labeled (WeatherPy).

I used the format provided by the Starter-Code files provided.

I utilized the website (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html), (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html), and (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html#scipy-api) for assistance in determining what operations to use in my code.

I used https://pypi.org/project/citipy/ as directed by the instructions.

I utilized the APIs for two websites: (https://openweathermap.org) and (https://www.geoapify.com).
